# The Final
---

Here is a repository in which you can gather all your materials together for your final. A reminder as to what should be included in here:
* 1 python script wherein you showcase your ability to achieve a total of 8 of the 13 learning objectives provided on Campuswire.
* A summary for your script, where you describe what problem the script was meant to solve, how you solved it, what learning objectives the script showcases, and on _what line number(s) each of those objectives were demonstrated_! These summaries can be included in the doc-string of your actual scripts if you like, or include them here as a simple pdf or text file. Please no Microsoft Word or similar type files.
* Any other supplemental material your script needs to run (data files, text files, images, etc). Make sure to upload these so that I can run your script the exact same way you could!

There should be submitted by the end of Friday, May 8th, as that is the technical day of your final. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask, but otherwise please work mostly independently on these.

Thank you all for the wonderful semester!
